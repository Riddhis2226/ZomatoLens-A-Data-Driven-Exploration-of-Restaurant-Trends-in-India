# 📊 ZomatoLens: A Data-Driven Exploration of Restaurant Trends in India

> ✨ A complete, multi-level data analysis and visualization project built during my internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**, using Python, Pandas, and Plotly.

## 🧠 Overview

**ZomatoLens** is an interactive analytics project based on a real-world restaurant dataset. Over the course of 3 levels of structured tasks, this project uncovers insights into:

- 🔍 Customer ratings
- 🛵 Online delivery trends
- 🍽️ Cuisine preferences
- 💸 Price distribution
- 🌆 City-wise restaurant density
- 📈 Predictive modeling (in Level 3)
